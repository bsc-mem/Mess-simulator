# Mess-simulator

Mess simulators is an abstract memory model based on bandwidth--latency curves. It matches the performance of the main memory to the input bandwidth--latency curves. The input bandwidth--latency curves can be obtained by running Mess benchmark on actual hardware or recieved from memory manufacturer, e.g. based on their detailed hardware model. 

The Mess simulator approach is based on the proportionalâ€“integral controller mechanism from the control theory to match its output to its input bandwidth--latency curves. 

Currently Mess simulator exists in standalone mode and integrated mode. It is integrated with ZSim, gem5 and OpenPiton Metro-MPI simulators. The simulator is implemented in C++ with a simple interface to be integrated to any CPU simulator.
