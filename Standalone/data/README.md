# Bandwidth-Latency Curves

This directory contains pre-generated bandwidth-latency curves for different systems and configurations. These curves are fundamental to the Mess Framework, as they model memory system performance under varying traffic intensities. Each folder corresponds to a specific system, with individual curves stored in files named bwlat_X.txt, where X represents the read percentage for that curve.

### File Format

Each curve file (bwlat_X.txt) contains two columns:
- Column 1: Bandwidth (MB/s).
- Column 2: Latency (ns).

Here is an example of the content from one curve file:

```text
47600.27    1363.58
47350.61    1360.66
47131.86    1368.02
47475.59    1378.44
47496.55    1385.77
47531.14    1395.75
47548.13    1407.44
47581.48    1408.28
```

### Directory Structure

Each folder corresponds to a specific system or configuration and contains multiple files for different read-to-write ratios. For example, bwlat_0.txt represents 0% reads (100% writes), and bwlat_50.txt represents 50% reads and 50% writes.
