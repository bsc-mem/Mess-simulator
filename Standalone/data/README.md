# BW Latency Curves

Each folder contains bandwidth--latency curves for one system. Each curve of the bandwdith--latency curves is stored in one file with the name `bwlat_number.txt`, where number is the read percentage for each curve. The files contains two coloumns. First coloums is the bandwidth (MB/s) and the second coloum is latency (cycles). 




## Explain what data we have


- a64fx - hbm2e: This folder includes the information related to bandwidth--latency curves of Fujitsu A64FX CPU with 48 cores and 4 HBM2 memory. These curves are generated by running Mess benchmark on ARM-CTE cluster of MareNostrum 4. For more information please see https://github.com/bsc-mem/Mess-benchmark/tree/main/CPU/Actual-hardware/ARM/A64FX.
  
- graviton3 - ddr5: This folder includes the information related to bandwidth--latency curves of Amazon Graviton3 CPU with 64 cores and 8 DDR5-4800 memory. These curves are generated by running Mess benchmark on Amazon AWS. For more information please see https://github.com/bsc-mem/Mess-benchmark/tree/main/CPU/Actual-hardware/ARM/Graviton3.
 
- skylake - ddr4: This folder includes the information related to bandwidth--latency curves of Intel Skylake CPU with 24 cores and 6 DDR5-2666 memory. These curves are generated by running Mess benchmark on MareNostrum 4. For more information please see https://github.com/bsc-mem/Mess-benchmark/tree/main/CPU/Actual-hardware/x86/Intel-Skylake-Xeon-Platinum-8160
  
- skylake - numa - ddr4: This folder includes the information related to bandwidth--latency curves of dual socket Intel Skylake CPU with 24 cores and 6 DDR5-2666 memory per socket. The curves target the latency between CPU located on socket 0 and memory located on Socket 1. These curves are generated by running Mess benchmark on MareNostrum 4. For more information please see https://github.com/bsc-mem/Mess-benchmark/tree/main/CPU/Actual-hardware/x86/Intel-Skylake-Xeon-Platinum-8160
  
- cxl: This folder includes the information related to bandwidth--latency curves of CXL memory expanders. The curves are generated from detailed simulation of Micron technology. For more information see Mess paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10170).
