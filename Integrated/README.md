# Mess-simulator integrated with CPU simulators

Mess simulators is an abstract memory model based on bandwidth--latency curves. It matches the peroformance of the main memory to the input bandwidth--latency curves. The input bandwidth--latency curves can be obtained by running Mess benchmark on actual hardware or recieved from memory manufacturer, e.g. based on their detailed hardware model. 


Currenty Mess simulator is integrated with the following CPU simulators:

- ZSim as a representative of event-based simulator 
- gem5 as a representative of cycle-accurate simulator
- OpenPiton Metro-MPI as a representative of RTL simulator
